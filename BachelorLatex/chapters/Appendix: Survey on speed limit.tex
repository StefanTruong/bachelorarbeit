\label{chapter:Appendix: Survey on speed limit}
In this survey, two students, Jonathan Scholz and Pantelis Antoniadis, were asked to provide their opinions on how fast they would like to ride their motorcycles on various road sections presented to them. To inform their judgments, the students were provided with information on the curvature values of the roads and a picture of each road. However, other factors such as scenic views or small towns were intentionally disregarded in order to isolate the effect of curvature on the students' preferences. The purpose of the survey was to gain insights into how motorcyclists' preferences for riding speed may be influenced by road curvature, and to adjust the configuration of the model simulations that take these preferences into account.
