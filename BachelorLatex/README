An Acronym Environment for LaTeX

INSTALLATION:
 - call 'latex acronym.ins' and copy the acronym.sty - file into
   a path searched by LaTeX.
 - to re-generate the documentation, call latex acronym.dtx

While writing a paper on cellular mobile radio I had to used a lot of
acronyms.  Acronyms can be quite disturbing for the novice reader ...

The Acronym package provides tooling to make sure that all acronyms used in
the text are spelled out in full at least once and it provides an
environment to keep a list of used acronyms.

Note that acronym requires the 'suffix' package. You can find it on 
CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/bigfoot/

Files of the `acronym' package:
  README         This file
  acronym.dtx    Sourcecode, example file & documentation
  acronym.ins    Installation script generating the source and an example
  acronym.pdf    PDF Version of the Docs
  CHANGES        list of changes
